# Personalized Promotions using Credit Card History
___

## Problem Statement:
The project aims to leverage machine learning and data mining techniques to develop a personalized promotions system based on credit card usage history. The specific challenge addressed is the need to enhance customer engagement and increase sales by tailoring promotional offers to individual customer preferences and spending behaviors.

## Assumptions and EDA Insights:
We assume that customer spending patterns exhibit distinct trends based on factors such as demographics, seasonality, and card type. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will provide deep insights into the dataset, confirming or denying assumptions and revealing important patterns. For instance, we anticipate that certain months will show higher transaction volumes and specific customer segments will have varying preferences for spending categories.
